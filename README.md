# KU Community Polling and Survey Web Application

## Overview

This web application is designed for the KU community to conduct surveys and polls. It provides a user-friendly interface to create polls, respond to them, and view or modify responses within a specified polling period. The main features of the application include:

- **Poll Creation:** Authenticated users can create polls with multiple-choice questions, specifying a start and end date for the polling period.
- **Poll Participation:** Users can submit their response to a poll during the polling period. They can also revisit and modify their response before the poll's end date.

- **Portable and Simple Installation:** The application is designed to be portable and easy to install.
